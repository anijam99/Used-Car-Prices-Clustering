## Used Car Price Analysis & Clustering Project
📌 Project Overview

This project conducts a cluster analysis on a dataset of 2,059 used car transactions to uncover key factors influencing pricing, demand, and sales. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to used car resellers, helping them optimize pricing strategies, inventory selection, and marketing approaches for maximum profitability.

The analysis leverages Python (Jupyter Notebook) and applies K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to segment the dataset into meaningful groups. The findings are visualized to highlight trends and support strategic decision-making.
